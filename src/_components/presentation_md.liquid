I’ve been Rails developer since 2008, and a Jekyll/Bridgetown site builder since 2015.

And as a designer/developer in general, since 1997!!! 😱

# So…why fork Jekyll?

## What was wrong with it anyway?

---
class: animated fadeIn

# Web “Sites” vs. “Applications”

Throughout the early 2010s, I was happily creating nifty apps in Rails for myself and for clients—yet I was simultaneously frustrated that I was forced to use crummy CMSes to create content-focused sites for clients.

WordPress? _Perish the thought!_

Drupal? _Spare me._

A Rails-based CMS like Refinery? _Meh._ 😕

--

### **Then I discovered Jekyll.**

# Ticking All the Boxes

.small[![Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/img/logo-2x.png)]

* Jekyll is powered by Ruby and Liquid templates.
* Jekyll is purpose-built for one thing and one thing only: generating websites.
* Jekyll sites are simply static snapshots of a Git-based content repository. You can host that output ANYWHERE. It's just compiled HTML/CSS/Javascript.
* The most basic way you author content with Jekyll is…write Markdown in a text file. Add smarts with Liquid tags. Git commit. Boom. Done.
* Want to provide a visual editor for non-techies? No problem! It can just open/save files under the hood and generate live previews, or you feed it data via an API (aka a “headless” CMS).

## This approach has now come to be called the **Jamstack**

### **JAM**.gray[…]stack

### JAM .gray[=] **J**avascript, **A**PIs, **M**arkup

And there are a ton of Jamstack tools and frameworks out now, not just Jekyll.

Which, coincidentally, brings us to today's topic.

### Where is Bridgetown?

### Who is Bridgetown?

![Why is Bridgetown](/assets/why-is-bridgetown.jpg)

class: animated fadeIn

# In a nutshell…

## ⬇️ Releases on GitHub since April 2020 ⬇️

* Bridgetown: **34**
* Hugo (written in Go): **27**
* Next.js (written in JavaScript): **15** (not including daily canary builds)
* Jekyll…

--

* Jekyll (written in Ruby): **6** 😬  
_(and when Bridgetown first forked, 8 months of inactivity!)_

--

* Eleventy (also JavaScript): **3** 🤔

.medium[![Eleventy replaces Jekyll?](/assets/eleventy-replaces-jekyll.png)]

## Um…

## Is this true??

.medium[![ruby-is-slow-dependency-hell](/assets/ruby-is-slow-dependency-hell.png)]

## Ruby is slow and suffers from dependency hell?!?

---
class: center middle animated zoomIn

# 🙁

## So Twitter is a dumpster fire 🔥, and meanwhile the unfortunate reality is that Jekyll slowly faded into “maintenance mode” after lead maintainer Parker Moore left mid-2019.

---
class: center middle animated zoomIn faster

# 🥺

## And this came at a time when Jekyll and the ecosystem's DX (developer experience) was _desperately_ in need of **modernization** (to survive the onslaught of new hotness rivals).

---
class: center middle animated zoomIn faster

# 😭

## So I had a lengthy conversation in a GitHub issue with the Jekyll core team about all that…

---
class: center middle animated zoomIn faster

# 🧐

## …and, while amicable, it did not go as I had hoped.

---
class: center middle animated zoomIn faster

# 🤔

## So I began to ponder my future as a Jamstack web designer.

---
class: center middle animated zoomIn faster

# 😣

## I did not want to have to abandon Ruby and suffer in the Go or JavaScript world forevermore.

---
class: center middle animated zoomIn faster

# 😒

## Middleman? Uh, erm, huh, hmm…<br/><br/>not for me I'm afraid.

---
class: center middle animated zoomIn faster

# 😃💡

## But then I had a .gray[<strike>crazy</strike>] great idea!

# A Brief Timeline of Its First Days…

* **April 2, 2020:** Cloned Jekyll repo and batch-renamed all identifiers to Bridgetown. Astonishingly, it actually worked !!
* **April 3-5:** Completed in-depth code audit, started cleaning up and rearranging the furniture.
* **April 5-9:** Started work on new website & logo, updating and rewriting documentation, etc.
* **April 9:** First big new "feature" — `bridgetown console`
* **April 13:** Notified Jekyll core team of Bridgetown fork.
* **April 18:** A true frontend integration with Webpack! 🎉
* **April 18-Present:** A caffeine/beer-infused haze of releases, announcements, enhancements, PR merges, and sponsorships galore.

## Let's take stock of what we've accomplished and then see where this is all headed.

---
class: animated fadeInRight

## Bridgetown Features **Already Released** – Part I

* ✅ A **predictable release schedule** based on SemVer.
* ✅ **Streamlined internals** to remove deprecated or legacy code paths and reduce confusing configuration options.
* ✅ **Improved default site file/folder structure** to bring Bridgetown in line with other popular static site generators.
* ✅ **Retooled the codebase** into a monorepo of multiple gems.
* ✅ Integrated **pagination features** directly into the monorepo. 
* ✅ Added streamlined taxonomy solution (for categories, tags, and other metadata) called **Prototype Pages**.
* ✅ **Added** the Rails-inspired `bridgetown console` command.
* ✅ Removed the aging asset pipeline to **regroup around a modern solution:  
Yarn + Webpack.** (Plus Browsersync for live reload!)

---
class: animated fadeInRight

## Bridgetown Features **Already Released** – Part II

* ✅ Added **Ruby template** support (ERB, Haml, etc.) as a first-class citizen.
* ✅ You can supercharge content logic with **Ruby Front Matter**.
* ✅ Theme support via Gem-based plugins with **NPM/Webpack integration**. 🤯
* ✅ Thor-based **automations** which allow for repeatable configuration of Bridgetown sites, great for gem/theme authors (think RailsBytes but for Bridgetown!)
* ✅ An easy to use, **brand-new DSL** for writing Bridgetown plugins that far outstrips what is possible with Jekyll.
* ✅ Building upon that DSL, **superior support** for third-party content/data APIs as well as GraphQL endpoints.
* ✅ **Hot reloading** of in-repo custom Ruby plugins during development. 🎉

---
class: animated fadeInRight

## **Coming Soon** to Bridgetown

* ✳️ **View Components**: makes Ruby component-based design and authoring a reality, plus support for the actual `ViewComponent` Rails engine. 😁
* ✳️ Built-in configuration options for **PostCSS**, **Snowpack**, **Hotwire**, and other frontend innovations.
* ✳️ A total low-level **overhaul** of the Jekyll-forked content classes to fix numerous design flaws and power the **next 10 years** of Bridgetown.
* ✳️ _I18n_ features at the core so pages can be generated in **multiple languages**—or generate multiple complete sites from one codebase!
* ✳️ **Rails Nano**: optional integration with a lightweight Rails backend for a **melt-your-brain Ruby on Rails on Bridgetown on Jamstack** hybrid application architecture! 🤓
